      <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        The African fintech landscape is experiencing unprecedented transformation, driven by mobile money adoption, blockchain innovation, and artificial intelligence. From M-Pesa's evolution to emerging DeFi platforms, the continent is becoming a global leader in financial technology.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Mobile Money Revolution</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Kenya's M-Pesa continues to lead the mobile money revolution, with over 50 million active users across Africa. The platform has evolved beyond simple money transfers to include savings, loans, and investment products. Similar innovations are emerging across the continent, with platforms like MTN Mobile Money in Ghana and Airtel Money in Nigeria gaining significant traction.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Blockchain and DeFi</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Decentralized finance (DeFi) is gaining momentum in Africa, with platforms like Yellow Card and Bundle Africa enabling cryptocurrency trading and lending. These platforms are particularly popular among young Africans who see crypto as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">AI-Powered Financial Services</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing credit scoring and risk assessment in Africa. Companies like Tala and Branch International use alternative data sources and machine learning algorithms to provide loans to individuals who would otherwise be excluded from traditional banking systems.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Regulatory Landscape</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        African governments are increasingly recognizing the importance of fintech innovation and are implementing supportive regulatory frameworks. The Central Bank of Nigeria's sandbox approach and Kenya's progressive fintech regulations serve as models for other African nations.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Future Outlook</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The next decade will see even more innovation in African fintech, with increased focus on cross-border payments, digital identity solutions, and financial inclusion. The continent's young, tech-savvy population and growing smartphone penetration create the perfect conditions for continued fintech growth.

      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Google's recent announcement of a $1 billion investment in African digital infrastructure, including data centers, signals the growing importance of the continent in global tech strategy. Microsoft's Azure regions in South Africa and plans for expansion across West Africa demonstrate the strategic value of local data processing capabilities.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Local Innovation</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        African companies like Liquid Intelligent Technologies and Rack Centre are leading the charge in building world-class data center facilities. These local providers understand the unique challenges and opportunities of the African market, from power infrastructure to regulatory compliance.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Economic Impact</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Diagnostic AI</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Companies like Zipline are using AI-powered drones to deliver medical supplies to remote areas, while diagnostic platforms like Ada Health provide AI-powered symptom checking and triage. These technologies are particularly valuable in regions with limited access to medical specialists.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Telemedicine Revolution</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
