## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Rich Text Editor Complexity**: Allocate extra time for TipTap integration
2. **Performance with Large Data Sets**: Implement pagination and virtualization early
3. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Regular testing during development
4. **State Management Complexity**: Modularize stores and implement clear patterns

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined phases and features
2. **Testing Delays**: Integrate testing throughout development
3. **Dependency Issues**: Research dependencies thoroughly before implementation

### Quality Risks
1. **Inconsistent UI**: Use design system and component library
2. **Poor Performance**: Regular performance testing
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security reviews
